## Original Requirements
The boss has asked for a Command Line Interface (CLI) snake game to be developed using the Pygame library.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a simple and engaging CLI snake game using Pygame",
    "Ensure the game is easy to install and run on any system with Python and Pygame installed",
    "Provide a high score feature to track the player's best performance"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to be able to easily start the game from the command line",
    "As a user, I want to be able to control the snake using my keyboard",
    "As a user, I want the game to become progressively more difficult as my score increases",
    "As a user, I want to be able to see my highest score from previous games",
    "As a user, I want the game to run smoothly without any lags or glitches"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Python Snake Game: A simple CLI snake game developed using Python. It lacks a high score feature and smooth gameplay",
    "Snake Game by Platty Soft: A more advanced version with a GUI. It's not CLI-based and requires more resources to run",
    "Classic Snake Game by Softonic: A classic version of the game with a GUI. It's not CLI-based and is not developed using Python",
    "Snake by Microsoft: A version of the game included with Windows. It's not CLI-based and is not developed using Python",
    "Snake '97: A mobile version of the game. It's not CLI-based, not developed using Python, and is not available for desktop systems"
]
```

```

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a CLI-based snake game developed using the Pygame library. It should include features such as keyboard controls, progressive difficulty, a high score tracker, and smooth gameplay.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Develop the basic game mechanics (snake movement, eating, growing, and game over conditions)", "P0"),
    ("Implement keyboard controls for the game", "P0"),
    ("Design a system for increasing game difficulty as the score increases", "P1"),
    ("Create a high score feature to track the player's best performance", "P1"),
    ("Ensure the game runs smoothly without any lags or glitches", "P0")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The game will be a CLI-based application. The game field will be represented as a grid in the terminal window. The snake will be represented as a line of characters that moves around the grid. The food for the snake will be represented as a different character. The score and high score will be displayed at the top of the game field.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.
