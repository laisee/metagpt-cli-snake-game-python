## Implementation approach
To implement this CLI-based snake game, we will use the Pygame library which is an open-source module for Python programming specifically for game development. The game will be developed in a procedural programming style. The main challenges will be to implement the game mechanics such as the snake's movement, eating, growing, and game over conditions. We will also need to implement keyboard controls for the game and design a system for increasing game difficulty as the score increases. We will also create a high score feature to track the player's best performance. Lastly, we need to ensure that the game runs smoothly without any lags or glitches.

## Python package name
```python
"cli_snake_game"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "scoreboard.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid

    class Game{
        +int score
        +int high_score
        +start_game()
        +end_game()
    }
    class Snake{
        +list body
        +str direction
        +move()
        +grow()
    }
    class Food{
        +tuple position
        +generate()
    }
    class ScoreBoard{
        +int score
        +int high_score
        +update_score()
        +update_high_score()
    }
    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: controls
    Game "1" -- "1" Food: generates
    Game "1" -- "1" ScoreBoard: updates
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    participant SB as ScoreBoard
    M->>G: create game
    G->>S: create snake
    G->>F: generate food
    G->>SB: create scoreboard
    loop Game Loop
        G->>S: move snake
        alt if snake eats food
            S->>S: grow snake
            G->>F: generate new food
            G->>SB: update score
        end
        alt if snake hits boundary or itself
            G->>G: end game
            G->>SB: update high score
        end
    end
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
