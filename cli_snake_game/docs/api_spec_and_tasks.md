## Required Python third-party packages
```python
"""
pygame==2.0.1
"""
```

## Required Other language third-party packages
```python
"""
None
"""
```

## Full API spec
```python
"""
No API spec required as this is a CLI-based game.
"""
```

## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the program. It should initialize the game and start the game loop."),
    ("game.py", "Contains the Game class which controls the game loop, the creation of other objects (Snake, Food, ScoreBoard), and the game over condition."),
    ("snake.py", "Contains the Snake class which handles the movement and growth of the snake."),
    ("food.py", "Contains the Food class which generates the food in random positions."),
    ("scoreboard.py", "Contains the ScoreBoard class which updates and displays the score and high score.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "scoreboard.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'pygame' is a Python library for making games. It provides functionalities for graphics, sound, and input handling (keyboard, mouse, joystick).
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. The main challenge will be to implement the game mechanics and ensure that the game runs smoothly.
